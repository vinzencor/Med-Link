---

## Architecture Overview

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| State | React Context (`AppContext`, `AuthContext`) |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS) |
| Auth | Supabase Auth |
| Storage | Supabase Storage |
| Email | Resend (via Supabase Edge Functions) |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Routing | React Router v6 |

---

## User Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| `job_seeker` | Job feed, applications, profile, marketplace |
| `student` | Same as job seeker |
| `recruiter` | Recruiter dashboard, post jobs, view applicants, reveals |
| `admin` | Full admin panel at `/admin/dashboard` |

Admin user is auto-assigned via Supabase DB trigger — set `rahulpradeepan55@gmail.com` as admin in `profiles.role`.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY
```

For Supabase Edge Functions (email notifications), set via Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## Supabase Setup

### 1. Run schema migrations

```bash
# Initial schema
psql -h db.YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co -U postgres -f supabase_schema.sql

# Feature migration (video, employer status, consent, notifications, etc.)
psql -h db.YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co -U postgres -f supabase_migration_002.sql
```

### 2. Create Storage Buckets

Go to **Supabase Dashboard → Storage** and create:

| Bucket | Public |
|---|---|
| `profile-videos` | ✅ Yes |
| `profile-avatars` | ✅ Yes |
| `application-cvs` | ❌ Private |
| `user-documents` | ❌ Private |
| `ad-images` | ✅ Yes |

### 3. Set RLS Policies

All tables have RLS enabled. Key policies:

- `profiles` — users read/update own; admins read all
- `notifications` — users read/mark own
- `audit_logs` — admins read; service role insert
- `certificates` — users CRUD own

## Running Locally

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:8080`

## Feature Modules

### Video Introduction (Mandatory)
- Upload via `ProfilePage` → Supabase Storage `profile-videos` bucket
- Status: `pending → approved / rejected` (admin approves in Applicant Management tab)
- Job seekers cannot apply until video is uploaded

### Employer Reveals System
- Plans: Agency (10 reveals/$40), Pro (25 reveals/$119), Enterprise (unlimited/$249)
- Add-ons: Match Alerts ($12), Assessment Reports ($10), Branding ($14)
- Reveal counter shown in `RecruiterDashboard` with progress bar and warning at ≤3 remaining

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
| Tab | Features |
|---|---|
| Overview | Stats, charts, recent activity |
| Job Approvals | Approve/reject pending jobs |
| User Management | Edit users, change roles, delete |
| Applicant Management | Doc verify, video approve/reject, monthly intake lock (120/mo) |
| Employer Management | Approve/suspend employers, reveal reset |
| Revenue | MRR, ARR, invoice ledger, commission tracking |
| Ads & Partners | Ad management, partner directory |

### VAS Marketplace (`/marketplace`)
- Partner services: LinguaPro, LicenseEase, NursePortfolio, DepartureReady
- One-time mock purchase → `purchaseAddOn()` in AppContext
- Certificate upload → Supabase `certificates` table → badge auto-assigned
- Badge carousel on Profile page

### Notifications
- Real-time bell in Header with unread count badge
- Click to mark as read; "Mark all read" action
- Triggered on: video upload, purchase, badge earned, job matches

### GDPR Consent
- `ConsentModal` shown on first login
- 3-checkbox agreement (Terms + Privacy + DPA)
- Writes `consent_given: true` + `consent_date` to `profiles` table

### Audit Logging
- `src/lib/audit.ts` — `logAction()` + convenience `audit.*` helpers
- Writes to `audit_logs` table (viewable by admins)
- Degrades gracefully to `console.info()` when table unavailable
